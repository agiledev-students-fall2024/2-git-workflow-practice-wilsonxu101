# Article

I read an article on **[The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/which-programming-languages-use-the-least-electricity/)** that explores an often-overlooked aspect of software development that I never bother to look into as well: the energy efficiency of programming languages. The article shows the ranking of different programming languages based on the amount of electricity they consume during execution. What I find particularly interesting is that the C Language is the most energy efficient and how it raises awareness about the environmental impact of choosing a language to work with. Usually I like to choose python to work with cause I find it easier to code but I never thought if it was environmental firendly to use it compare to other languages. This article shows that our choices as developers can have far-reaching consequences, not only on performance but also on the environment.

## Nathan Daniel's Thoughts (WayyGood)
What really stood out to me from the data was how imperative programming languages, such as C, consistently outperform other paradigms in terms of memory usage, energy consumption, and execution time. Imperative languages run much faster and more efficiently compared to object-oriented, functional, and scripting languages. This highlights the efficiency of languages like C and Pascal, especially when trying to optomize for factors like time, energy, and memory use.
