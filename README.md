# Article

I read an article on **[The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/which-programming-languages-use-the-least-electricity/)** that explores an often-overlooked aspect of software development that I never bother to look into as well: the energy efficiency of programming languages. The article shows the ranking of different programming languages based on the amount of electricity they consume during execution. What I find particularly interesting is that the C Language is the most energy efficient and how it raises awareness about the environmental impact of choosing a language to work with. Usually I like to choose python to work with cause I find it easier to code but I never thought if it was environmental firendly to use it compare to other languages. This article shows that our choices as developers can have far-reaching consequences, not only on performance but also on the environment.
